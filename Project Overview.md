# Lending Club Project

In this project, I used logistic regression to predict the probability of fully paid at the end for each loan based on the loan applications and assigned credit grades based on the probability. The model predicted results will be compared with original credit grades results with additional analysis.

The process are showcased in multiple notebooks, and they include:

1. **[Data Exploration and Transformation]**
2. **[Missing Value Analysis and Solutions]**
3. Feature Engineering and Feature Selections *(Coming Soon)*
4. Model Building and Predictions *(Coming Soon)*
5. Result Evaluation and Analysis *(Coming Soon)*

Yuguan Liu also contributed to the first notebook, *Data Exploration and Transformation*.
