# Lending Club Project

In this project, I will use logistic regression to predict the probability of fully paid at the end for each loan application. The process will be showcased in multiple notebooks, and they include:

1. Data Exploration and Transformation
2. Missing Value Analysis and Solutions
3. Feature Engineering and Feature Selections
4. Model Building and Predictions
5. Result Evaluation and Analysis
