# Lending Club Project

In this project, I used logistic regression to predict the probability of fully paid at the end for each loan based on the loan applications and assigned credit grades based on the probability. The model predicted results will be compared with original credit grades results with additional analysis.

As the result showed in training data doesn't provide a better assessment on borrower's credit risks, the solution is not moving forward. However, for future improvement, other models and methodologies should be explored.

The process are showcased in multiple notebooks, and they include:
